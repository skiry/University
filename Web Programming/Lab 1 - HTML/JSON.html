JSON: JavaScript Object Notation.<br>

JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.<br>

JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation.<br>
When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text.<br>

JSON is text, and we can convert any JavaScript object into JSON, and send JSON to the server.<br>

We can also convert any JSON received from the server into JavaScript objects.<br>

This way we can work with the data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLES<br><br>

Sending Data<br>

If you have data stored in a JavaScript object, you can convert the object into JSON, and send it to a server:<br>
Example<br><br>

var myObj = {name: "John", age: 31, city: "New York"};<br>
var myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);<br>
window.location = "demo_json.php?x=" + myJSON;<br><br>

Receiving Data<br>

If you receive data in JSON format, you can convert it into a JavaScript object:<br>
Example<br>
<br>
var myJSON = '{"name":"John", "age":31, "city":"New York"}';<br>
var myObj = JSON.parse(myJSON);<br>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myObj.name; <br>
  </body>
