G = (N, E, P, S)
N = set of non-terminals
E = set of terminals
P = set of productions
S = starting symbol

FA = (Q, E, ro, q0, F)
Q = set of states
E = alphabet
ro = set of transitions
qo = starting state
F = set of final states

A regular grammar is a left linear grammar (S->Aa, for any S, A from the non-terminals set and 'a' a terminal) \
	or a right linear grammar (S->aA, for any S, A from the non-terminals set and 'a' a terminal) and if there are \
	S->E with S from the non-terminals set and E the empty string, epsilon, then S does not appear in the rhs of any production
